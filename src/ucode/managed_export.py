"""`ucode export`: serialize the workspace's managed coding-agent config to portable JSON.

Reads the local managed config (the one file :mod:`ucode.managed_config` owns, authored by
``ucode setup`` and refreshed by a launch), validates and serializes it through the same path
``ucode apply`` uses, and writes the external proto-JSON ``CodingAgentConfig`` — prefixed with the
source ``workspace`` and a ``spec_version`` envelope, the format a future ``ucode publish -f <path>``
will consume — to stdout or a file.

Deliberately read-only and offline: no auth, no admin check, no discovery, no publish, and no write
except the explicitly requested ``--output`` file. That makes it role-agnostic (any developer can
run it) and keeps the machine-readable stream on stdout uncontaminated by Rich output.
